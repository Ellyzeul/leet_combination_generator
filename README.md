# 1337 Combination Generator

This project goal is quite simple: given a word return all the possibilities of rewriting this same word using numbers, symbols, lower/uppercase, accented letters and so forths. But why?

## Motivation

Something that I noticed, and also watched videos about, is the problem of troll/malicious comments on YouTube, how it is a trouble to deal with by banning each word and it's possible combinations that try to bypass the filter so, having a tool capable of generate each possible combination of symbols to reproduce the same wanted word would be truly useful.
Of course it may have other uses (that I don't even know yet) but my original motivation was that.
